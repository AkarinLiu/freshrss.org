# freshrss.org

Content files for [freshrss.org](http://freshrss.org) website.

freshrss.org uses [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/) as static site generator. It is a powerful Python software which generates HTML from Markdown or reStructuredText formats.

This repository only contains raw content (in Markdown) and does not host FreshRSS theme nor configuration files. Instructions to build FreshRSS website will come later in their own repository.

Actually, there is only one content file: `./pages/index.html`. Yes, it is HTML. It is the home page content of freshrss.org and is very specific.

The blog is not yet supported by FreshRSS Pelican theme so blog posts are not present yet. Blog posts will be written in Markdown under a `./blog` directory.
